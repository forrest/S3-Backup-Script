S3 Backup Solution====


This was a simple script I threw together at Smibs (www.smibs.com) to make offsite backups of our S3 buckets. We have this script run once a week on an offsite computer to make copies of the entire bucket.


Usage:
  Start by setting the path to your archive in the environment.rb file. Then add something like this to your crontab file.
  
  @weekly /<path-to-script>/main.rb production


TODO:

- Move Archive folder path to a config file.
- Add a maximum number of local copies to store.
- Tar old copies to save space and make it easier to work with.
